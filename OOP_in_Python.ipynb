In OOP, one class should not have direct access to the data of the other class or the access should be controlled via class methods. We can use private variables and properties in order to control access to class data. **__age** is private variable since there are two underscores in front of it. A property has three parts. You have to define the attribute, which is **age** in the below example. Next, you have to define the property for the attribute using the **@property decorator**. Finally, you have to create property setter which is **@age.setter** descriptor in the below example. We can say that age of employees should always between 18 and 99. If a user tries to enter a value for age less than 18 or more than 99, there will be an error and thus an object from **Employee** class cannot be created. However, if the value is between 18 and 99, an object can be created. We can create a property for the age attribute which implements this logic as in the below example."
